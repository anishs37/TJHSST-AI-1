# Tic-tac-toe
Tic-tac-toe is a turn-based game where players take turn placing either Xs or Os on a 3x3 board, in hopes of getting 3 of their character in a row, column, or diagonal.

## Description
This purpose of this lab is to moderate a tic-tac-toe game where the AI chooses a move that can maximize its win probability.

## Part 1: Minimax
The Tic-tac-toe game is moderated and the AI score is determined with the minimax algorithm.

To run the Tic-tac-toe game using the Minimax algorithm, run minimax.py with the following arguments:
- Argument #1: A string representation of a game (can be one in progress)

## Part 2: Negamax
The Tic-tac-toe game is moderated and the AI score is determined with the negamax algorithm.

To run the Tic-tac-toe game using the Negamax algorithm, run negamax.py with the following arguments:
- Argument #1: A string representation of a game (can be one in progress)

A sample run is provided should a reference be needed on how to continue playing the game.
