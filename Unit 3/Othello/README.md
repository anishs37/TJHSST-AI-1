# Othello
Othello is a two-player game on an 8x8 sized board. In othello, there is a fixed initial setup, where one player plays as black (and goes first), and the other playes as white. The objective is to have the majority of the board containing your colored pieces.

## Description
This purpose of this lab is to code an Othello AI that can maximize win probability.

The lab is coded using the following algorithms/techniques:
- Minimax
- Alpha/Beta Pruning

While it is not possible to run the code provided here on a local machine, my AI can be tested against other a human and other AIs using TJHSST's othello server.

Steps for running:
1. Go to: https://othello.tjhsst.edu/play/
2. Select 2023asusarla from the dropdown under either black or white
3. Select yourself (human will be the other player), random (a random AI will verse me), or another username
4. Specify a time limit (usually between 2-5 seconds)
5. Agree to the Othello specifications, and press Start Match!
