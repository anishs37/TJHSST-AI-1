# Train Routes
Modeling the North American train route network.

## Description
This purpose of this lab is to model and search the North American Train Network. The shortest path between two North American cities (cities in the rrNodeCity.txt file) is calculated.

## Part 1: Solver
Returning the minimum distance between two North American cities using Dijkstra and A*

To run Part 1, run TrainRoutes_Solver.py with city 1 as the first argument and city 2 as the second argument.

## Part 2: Animation
Builds off Part 1 by adding animation to the lab (such as highlighting all paths traversed and the final path)

To run Part 2, run TrainRoutes_Animation.py with city 1 as the first argument and city 2 as the second argument.

*Note that if a city has more than one word, you will need to surround the city in quotes when you run the code.
