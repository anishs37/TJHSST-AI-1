# Word Ladders
Program that generates word ladders based on the starting and ending letters.

## Description
Word ladders are sequences of words that each differ from the previous word by exactly one letter. The goal is to create a word ladder that connects a giving starting and ending word.

## Solver
This code will run the entire puzzles_longer.txt file in under 1 second.

You can run the code two ways, one which will run shorter puzzles and a shorter dictionary, and one that will run longer puzzles and a longer dictionary:
- Shorter: Run WordLadders.py with words_06_letters.txt as the first argument and puzzles_normal.txt as the second argument
- Longer: Run WordLadders.py with words_06_longer.txt as the first argument and puzzles_longer.txt as the second argument
