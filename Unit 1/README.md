# Unit 1: Search
In this unit, we covered uninformed search algorithms (algorithms that just try every possibility until the correct one is found) and progressed to informed search algorithms (algorithms that intelligently choose what directions to look next).

## Algorithms

The algorithms we covered in this unit include:
- BFS
- Bi-BFS
- ID-DFS
- A*
- Dijkstra

## Labs

The labs we covered in this unit, where the code for the lab is located in its respective subdirectory, are:
- Sliding Puzzles
- Train Routes
- Word Ladders
