# N-Queens
The N-Queens problem is the problem of placing N queens on an NxN size board so that no queen attacks each other.

## Description
This purpose of this lab is to solve N-Queens problems.

## Part 1: Backtracking
Returns a solved N-Queens puzzle using backtracking.

To run Part 1 (which will run a 31x31 and 33x33 N-Queens board), run NQueens_Backtrack.py (no arguments needed).

## Part 2: Incremental Repair
Returns a solved N-Queens puzzle using Incremental Repair.

To run Part 2 (which will run a 33x33 and 36x36 N-Queens board), run NQueens_IR.py (no arguments needed).

## Extension: Staircase Algorithm
Returns solved N-Queens puzzles from 8x8 upward until a 30-second time limit is reached using the staircase algorithm.

To run the extension, run NQueens_IR.py (no arguments required)
